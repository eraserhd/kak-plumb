Plumbing Text and Clicking
--------------------------

`Enter` is mapped to plumb the current selections.  Multiple selections are
plumbed iteratively.

If a selection is one character long, it is treated like a Plan 9 "click".
The surrounding (or following) WORD is plumbed instead, and a "click"
attribute is computed with the selection's offset.

`kakoune` is sent as the source, and the current working directory is sent.
Additionally, a `session` attribute is sent with the value of `%val{session}`.

All new functionality must contain tests.  See `test/tests.bash` for details.
